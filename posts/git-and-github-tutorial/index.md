I recently gave an ad hoc tutorial to a group of students on `git` and [Github](https://github.com).  It covers introductory commands and common use cases such as branching, merging, and common workflows that utilize [Github](https://github.com).  I screencasted the tutorial and recorded the live audio which can be viewed below.
