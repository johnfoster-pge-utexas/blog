<p>Since I started this blog in 2014, it has been entirely technical.  Usually
dedicated to examples that are intended to remind my future self and/or 
students of interesting problem solutions through code.  However, as we return to
in-person teaching in the Fall semester of 2021, under a <a href="https://protect.utexas.edu/health-and-wellness/">strong
recommendation</a> to wear masks,
I feel compelled to explain to my students why I won't be wearing one.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>This won't be a commentary giving my opinion on the effectiveness of masks, nor
a suggestion on whether any other individual should or should not wear one.
This is simply documenting how I arrived at my decision to not wear a mask.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Before any vaccine was available to me, I caught and recovered from COVID-19.
I confirmed that I have antibodies through a laboratory test in June of 2021.
A summary of the results are shown below and the full report can be downloaded
<a href="../../files/covid-antibody-results-redacted.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>).  </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../../files/covid-antibody-report.png"></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>This test is for antibodies against the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protien (S-protien) which are known to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w">wane over time</a>; however, 
in response to recovery from infection the immune system will also produce 
other antibodies (e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83108-0">N-protien</a>), <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">T-cells</a>, B memory cells, etc. The number of RBD-specific memory B cells has been shown to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w">remain unchanged after
SARS-CoV-2 infection and have a resistance to RBD mutations (i.e. variants)</a>.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>There are plenty of evidence-based findings that show that natural immunity is
very robust.  In <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v3">this
article</a> by
researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Health System, they follow over 50k
employees and report  </p>
<p><br><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>COVID-19 did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579 individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034545?query=recirc_mostViewed_railB_article">This report</a> following &gt;12,500 staff at the Oxford University 
Hospitals in the United Kingdom of which 1265 had positive antibody tests observed only 2 reinfections and they where both asymptotic.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762">A recent Israel
study</a> reported that of 835,792 Israelis known 
to have recovered from COVID-19, there where only 72 known instances of
reinfection (0.0086%) compared with over 3000 breakthrough infections of the
5,193,499 vaccinated (0.0578%).</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Finally, this last paper is not as statistically significant, but I think it’s interesting given the uniformity of the observation group. The paper <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/10/21-1427_article">Breakthrough Infections of SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant in Fully Vaccinated Gold Miners, French Guiana, 2021</a> with the main results summarized in <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/10/21-1427-t1">this table</a> describes a COVID outbreak among 44 gold miners, all men of roughly the same age and overall health status. Of the 44, 25 had been “fully vaccinated” and 9 had 1 dose — all Pfizer vaccines. Of the 25 fully vaccinated, 15 (!) had breakthrough infections. Of the 9 that had 1 dose, 6 had breakthrough infections. There were 6 that had recovered from COVID previously — 3 with 1 dose and 3 not vaccinated. Of those 6, none of them caught COVID in the outbreak.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>So it appears that I should be immune, but for how long? There was this very recent paper in Nature, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4">SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans</a> that was then covered in this news article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01442-9">Had COVID? You’ll probably make antibodies for a lifetime</a> that suggests a very long time, maybe forever.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Of course, these results should not be surprising, it's extremely rare to be
infected twice by the same virus in a lifetime.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">The same paper linked above
</a> demonstrates  </p>
<p><br><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>long-lasting T cells are reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV 17 years after the outbreak of SARS in 2003; these T cells displayed robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07231">this paper from 2008</a> demonstrates neutralizing
antibody responses in 32 (all of the participants) people who had survived the
1918 H1N1 flu pandemic as children -- 90 years later!</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Given these findings (and there are more, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v3">cf. Ref 6-8</a>, I concluded that my immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 is strong and long-lived.  However, there is a personal anecdote to share as well.  In early
August 2021, my wife visited a friend in Florida and 48 hours after her return
she fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19.  Two days after that her
daughter, my step-daugter who lives with us, also became ill with COVID-19.<br>
Because I already had plenty of exposure to both of them in the house by
the time we knew they were infected, I made no effort to quarantine myself from
them, and did what I could to make them comfortable.  My wife's case was fairly
mild with most of the symptoms subsiding after 5 days, my step-daughters case
was very mild and she was completely recovered in 36 hours.  After 8 days everyone 
was recovered with negative tests.  I did not experience any symptoms or have any reason to
believe I was infected during this time.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Given all the information above, I do not believe there is any medical reason
for me to wear a mask while teaching at this time.  I believe it's easier for the students
to comprehend what I'm saying without a mask on, it's easier for me to 
project my voice without, and it's certainly more comfortable.  I do plan to
continue to monitor my antibody levels and may change my mind in the future.</p>
