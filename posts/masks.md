Since I started this blog in 2014, it has been entirely technical.  Usually
dedicated to examples that are intended to remind my future self and/or 
students of interesting problem solutions through code.  However, as we return to
in-person teaching in the Fall semester of 2021, under a [strong
recommendation](https://protect.utexas.edu/health-and-wellness/) to wear masks,
I feel compelled to explain to my students why I won't be wearing one.

<br/>

This won't be a commentary giving my opinion on the effectiveness of masks, nor
a suggestion on whether any other individual should or should not wear one.
This is simply documenting how I arrived at my decision to not wear a mask.

<br/>

Before any vaccine was available to me, I caught and recovered from COVID-19.
I confirmed that I have antibodies through a laboratory test in June of 2021.
A summary of the results are shown below and the full report can be downloaded
<a href="/files/covid-antibody-results-redacted.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br/>

This test is for antibodies against the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein) which are known to [wane over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w); however, 
in response to recovery from infection the immune system will also produce 
other antibodies (e.g. [N-protein](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83108-0)), [T-cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z), B memory cells, etc. The number of RBD-specific memory B cells has been shown to [remain unchanged after
SARS-CoV-2 infection and have a resistance to RBD mutations (i.e. variants)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03207-w).

<br/>

There are plenty of evidence-based findings that show that natural immunity is
very robust.  In [this
article](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v3) by
researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Health System, they follow over 50k
employees and report  

<br/>

>COVID-19 did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579 individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine.

<br/>

[This report](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034545?query=recirc_mostViewed_railB_article) following >12,500 staff at the Oxford University 
Hospitals in the United Kingdom of which 1265 had positive antibody tests observed only 2 reinfections and they where both asymptomatic.

<br/>

[A recent Israel
study](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762) reported that of 835,792 Israelis known 
to have recovered from COVID-19, there where only 72 known instances of
reinfection (0.0086%) compared with over 3000 breakthrough infections of the
5,193,499 vaccinated (0.0578%) at the time of the report.

<br/>

Finally, this last paper is not as statistically significant, but I think it’s interesting given the uniformity of the observation group. The paper [Breakthrough Infections of SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant in Fully Vaccinated Gold Miners, French Guiana, 2021](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/10/21-1427_article) with the main results summarized in [this table](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/10/21-1427-t1) describes a COVID outbreak among 44 gold miners, all men of roughly the same age and overall health status. Of the 44, 25 had been “fully vaccinated” and 9 had 1 dose — all Pfizer vaccines. Of the 25 fully vaccinated, 15 (!) had breakthrough infections. Of the 9 that had 1 dose, 6 had breakthrough infections. There were 6 that had recovered from COVID previously — 3 with 1 dose and 3 not vaccinated. Of those 6, none of them caught COVID in the outbreak.

<br/>

So it appears that I should be immune, but for how long? There was this very recent paper in Nature, [SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-lived bone marrow plasma cells in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4) that was then covered in this news article [Had COVID? You’ll probably make antibodies for a lifetime](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01442-9) that suggests a very long time, maybe forever.

<br/>

Of course, these results should not be surprising, it's extremely rare to be
infected twice by the same virus in a lifetime.  [The same paper linked above
](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) demonstrates  

<br/>

>long-lasting T cells are reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV 17 years after the outbreak of SARS in 2003; these T cells displayed robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2.

<br/>

Perhaps most interesting, [this paper from 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07231) demonstrates neutralizing
antibody responses in 32 people (all of the participants)  who had survived the
1918 H1N1 flu pandemic as children -- 90 years later!

<br/>

Given these findings (and there are more, [cf. Ref 6-8](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v3), and [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3838993), [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3838993), [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100354), [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.14.452381v1), [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.12.443888v1), [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262111v1), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209951/pdf/RMV-9999-e2260.pdf), [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100861), [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255670v1), [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256578v1), [here](https://rupress.org/jem/article/218/5/e20202617/211835/Highly-functional-virus-specific-cellular-immune), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24377-1?utm_source=other&utm_medium=other&utm_content=null&utm_campaign=JRCN_1_LW01_CN_natureOA_article_paid_XMOL), [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.454333v1), [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1)), I concluded that my immunity to
SARS-CoV-2 is strong and long-lived.  However, there is a personal anecdote to share as well.  In early
August 2021, my wife visited a friend in Florida and 48 hours after her return
she fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19.  Two days after that her
daughter, my step-daughter who lives with us, also became ill with COVID-19.  Because 
I already had plenty of exposure to both of them in the house by
the time we knew they were infected, I made no effort to quarantine myself from
them and did what I could to make them comfortable.  My wife's case was fairly
mild with most of the symptoms subsiding after 5 days, my step-daughters case
was very mild and she was completely recovered in 36 hours.  After 8 days everyone 
was recovered with negative tests.  I did not experience any symptoms or have any reason to
believe I was infected during this time.

<br/>

Given all the information above, I do not believe there is any medical reason
for me to wear a mask while teaching at this time.  For all practical purposes, you cannot
catch a virus from which you are immune, and you certainly can't transmit a virus you don't have.
I believe it's easier for the students
to comprehend what I'm saying without a mask on, it's easier for me to 
project my voice without, and it's certainly more comfortable.  I do plan to
continue to monitor my antibody levels and may change my mind in the future.
